# Bitcoin-Blockchain-Simulation
Peer-To-Peer Bitcoin Blockchain Real Simulation using python with an easy to use UI, the reason behind this project is to simulate how bitcoin mechanisms and algorithms work.

## Installation
run command ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## How it works
### 1. boot : 
> Using low level sockets programming to ensure network agents p2p connections by manipulating their sockets 
### 2. agent (miner) : 
> Create and send Transaction, Block...
### 3. block & transaction & wallet
> Complex data types 

## Implemented functions:
- Consesus Algorithm
- Proof of Work
- Merkle root
- RSA Encryption and hashing 
- Timestamps
- Signatures

> Note: To be updated

## Testing
run ``test.bat`` to try out a bitcoin blockchain system with 2 agents, (you can launch as many agents as you want by running ``boot.py`` and then run ``agent.py`` on different terminals
